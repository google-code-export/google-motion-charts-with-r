     on 22 February 2012. 

NEW FEATURES

   o Quoted from Google
     http://code.google.com/apis/chart/interactive/docs/release_notes.html: 
     - Added gradient color mode to bubble chart.
     - Geo chart:
       * Region interactivity in marker mode is now disabled by
       	 default. How to keep the old behavior? Set the
   	 enableRegionInteractivity option to true.

       * Markers are now opaque by default. How to keep the old
         behaviour? Set the markerOpacity option to 0.5.

       * Marker size is now between 3 and 12 pixels by default. How to
         keep the old behavior? Set the sizeAxis option to {minSize: 2,
         maxSize: 30}.

       * A magnifying glass is now opened when the user hovers over
         cluttered markers (excluding IE<=8). How to keep the old
         behaviour? Set the magnifyingGlass option to {enable: false}.

       * Maps are not stretched by default anymore, but rather kept at
	 the original aspect ratio. How to keep the old behavior? Set the
  	 keepAspectRatio option to false.

   o Added demo AnimatedGeoChart. The demo shows how a Geo Chart can be animated
     with additional JavaScript, see also the demo AnimatedGeoMap.

Version 0.2.9 [2011-09-01]
==========================

Changes

   o The documentation of googleVis has been update to reflect a new
     version of the Google Visualisation API which was published on 
     13 July, see
     http://code.google.com/apis/chart/interactive/docs/release_notes.html#72011.

       Blogger and Google Sites

NEW FEATURES
 
    o New gvis.editor argument in options, which adds an edit
      button to the page, allowing the user to edit, change and
      customise the chart on the fly.


Version 0.2.8 [2011-07-31]
==========================

Changes

   o Updated package welcome message. The message asks the user to read Google's
     Visualisation and Maps API Terms of Use before she uses the functions of the
     googleVis package. 
	
   o The caption gvis-plots contain an additional link to Google's data policy.

   o New example for gvisBarChart using the XML package to chart online data from Wikipedia


Version 0.2.7 [2011-07-10]
==========================

Changes

      added to charts  

BUG FIXES

    o gvisGeoMap documentation stated that the default dataMode is
      'regions', but the function actually used 'markers'. The default
      for dataMode is now 'regions' and therefore in line with the
      help file.   

Version 0.2.6 [2011-06-12]
==========================

Changes

BUG FIXES

   o The way RJSONIO treats backslashes changed in version 0.7.1 and
     as a result some Google charts were no longer displayed.

Version 0.2.4 [2011-02-07]
==========================

Changes
   
   o plot.gvis no longer writes into the package folder. Instead
     temporary files are created. This overcomes the need to install
     the package into a directory with write access. Many thanks to
     Ben Bolker for this suggestion and code contribution.  
  
   o plot.gvis no longer requires the web server provided by
     the R.rsp package to display the visualisation output. Instead it
     uses the internal R HTTP help server. Many thanks to John Verzani
     for this suggestion and code contribution. 
  
   o R >= 2.11.0 is required to plot googleVis output, as it uses the
     internal R HTTP help server.
  
   o Updated vignette with a section on how to use googleVis with
     RApache and brew

NEW FEATURES

   o The plot function generates a web page which includes a link
     to the HTML code of the chart. Many thanks to Henrik Bengtsson
     for this suggestion.

   o gvis visualisation functions have a new argument 'chart id', to
     set the chart id of the exhibit manually. 	         

   o gvis functions return more details about the visualisation chart
     in a structured way. Suppose x is a 'gvis' object, than
     x$html$chart is a named character vector of the chart's
     JavaScript building blocks and html tags. 

   o print.gvis has a new argument 'tag', which gives the user more
     control over the output

   o Brew example files in: 
     system.file("brew", package = "googleVis")  

BUG FIXES

   o gvisTable did not accept datetime columns.

Version 0.2.3 [2010-12-19]
==========================

Changes
    
NEW FEATURES

   o gvisAnnotatedTimeLine accepts date in POSIX* formats

BUG FIXES

   o Google date objects expect the months Jan.- Dec. as 0 - 11 and
     not 1 - 12 
   o Fixed typo in the Andrew data set. The Pressure at 1992-08-24
     12:00:00 was 951 and not 51  

Version 0.2.2 [2010-12-12]
==========================

     to reflect a new more flexible implementation.

   o Output is now of class 'gvis' with generic print and plot
     functions.
   o 'gvis' objects are list of lists, which allow the user to extract
     the various parts of the visualisation output, e.g. the chart
     object.
  
NEW FEATURES

   o New functions:
     - gvisMotionChart to generate motion charts
     - gvisGeoMap to generate geographical maps
