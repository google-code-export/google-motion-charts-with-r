Version 0.2.4 [2011-01-17]
==========================

Changes
   
   o plot.gvis no longer writes into the package folder. Instead
     temporary files are created. This overcomes the need to install
     the package into a directory with write access. Many thanks to
     Ben Bolker for this suggestion and code.  
  
   o plot.gvis no longer requires the web server provided by
     the R.rsp package to display the visualisation output. Instead it
     uses the internal R HTTP help server. Many thanks to John Verzani
     for this suggestion and code. 
  
   o R >= 2.11.0 is required to plot googleVis output, as it uses the
     internal R HTTP help server. 
   
   o Updated vignette with a section on how to use googleVis with
     RApache 
 
NEW FEATURES

   o The plot function generates a web page which includes a link
     to the HTML code of the chart. Many thanks to Henrik Bengtsson
     for this suggestion.
